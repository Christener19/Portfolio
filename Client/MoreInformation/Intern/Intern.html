            I was one of six developers who worked on this project. We collaborated with a stakeholder to create a website for the School of Code that assists coaches in managing attendance tracking. We had a four-week deadline to complete this project. The result of our efforts is 'Intern,' a website designed to handle all the manual labor, thereby simplifying tasks for the coaches.

            Briefing day began with us creating our team manifesto, where we discussed and agreed upon our communication methods, decision-making processes, and conflict resolution strategies. We then received our problem statement: 'The School of Code requires an innovative and efficient solution for tracking and analyzing participant engagement and attendance in live Zoom classes. The existing manual process is laborious and fails to utilize the rich data available through Zoom's API. After receiving the brief, we knew we needed to understand the problem before we could start considering solutions. We began by addressing the 5 W's: Who, What, When, Where, and Why. Then, we worked on understanding the users of the product, such as the CEO and coaches to tailor our approach to their needs. Following this, we created a list of questions we had about the problem, and then we met with the stakeholder to get answers to our questions. With answers in mind we had an in-depth look at how the problem is already being solved.
