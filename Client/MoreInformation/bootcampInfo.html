            I was one of six developers who worked on this project. Where we were tasked with identifying and addressing common issues faced by bootcampers and developing a solution within a week, our team conducted user research and utilized the Disney ideation method to narrow down our problem statement. The result of our efforts is Bootcamp Kitchen, a website allowing users to discover recipes tailored to their preferences, whether it be specific ingredients or dietary requirements.

            We started by creating our team manifesto, where we discussed and agreed on how we would communicate with each other, make decisions, and resolve conflicts if any were to arise. Following this, we wrote down some problems/challenges we have faced during the bootcamp. From this, we developed a hypothesis: "Boot-campers are struggling to maintain nutritional self-care, as a result of feeling restricted by time."
            <br>
            <br>
            We then began to conduct user research to test our hypothesis by creating a survey, which was distributed among our cohort. After analyzing the responses, we confirmed the accuracy of our hypothesis. Additionally, we conducted interviews with members of our cohort to delve further into the identified problem.
            <br>
            <br>
            Following on from this, we conducted competitor research, examining existing solutions to the identified problem. We assessed the strengths and weaknesses of these solutions and considered potential improvements. Additionally, we looked at the UI and UX of our competitors to shape our vision for the website. We also delved into the science of healthy eating and its benefits, researching how the food we eat affects our bodies. Finally, we created two user persona's based on our research.
